# bind()

The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value.
It letâ€™s us explicitly define the value of this when calling a function.
```
var pokemon = {
    firstname: 'Pika',
    lastname: 'Chu ',
    getPokeName: function() {
        var fullname = this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
        return fullname;
    }
};

var pokemonName = function() {
    console.log(this.getPokeName() + 'I choose you!');
};

var logPokemon = pokemonName.bind(pokemon); // creates new object and binds pokemon. 'this' of pokemon === pokemon now

logPokemon(); // 'Pika Chu I choose you!'
```

After we bind() a value we can use the function just like it was any other normal function. We could even update the function to accept parameters, and pass them.

```
var pokemon = {
    firstname: 'Pika',
    lastname: 'Chu ',
    getPokeName: function() {
        var fullname = this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
        return fullname;
    }
};

var pokemonName = function(snack, hobby) {
    console.log(this.getPokeName() + 'I choose you!');
    console.log(this.getPokeName() + ' loves ' + snack + ' and ' + hobby);
};

var logPokemon = pokemonName.bind(pokemon); // creates new object and binds pokemon. 'this' of pokemon === pokemon now

logPokemon('sushi', 'algorithms'); // Pika Chu  loves sushi and algorithms
```
# call(), apply()

The call() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.

We can call a function, and explicitly specify what this should reference within the calling function.

>The call() method does not make a copy of the function it is being called on.

call() and apply() serve the exact same purpose. The only difference between how they work is that call() expects all parameters to be passed in individually, whereas apply() expects an array of all of our parameters

```
var pokemon = {
    firstname: 'Pika',
    lastname: 'Chu ',
    getPokeName: function() {
        var fullname = this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
        return fullname;
    }
};

var pokemonName = function(snack, hobby) {
    console.log(this.getPokeName() + ' loves ' + snack + ' and ' + hobby);
};

pokemonName.call(pokemon,'sushi', 'algorithms'); // Pika Chu  loves sushi and algorithms
pokemonName.apply(pokemon,['sushi', 'algorithms']); // Pika Chu  loves sushi and algorithms
```
